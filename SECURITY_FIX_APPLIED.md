# 🔒 Security Fix Applied - .env.test File

## ⚠️ **Issue Found:**
The `backend/.env.test` file was being tracked by git, which is a security risk because it contains:
- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets
- Test environment credentials

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### 1. Updated .gitignore
Added `.env.test` to the gitignore file in two locations:
```
# dotenv environment variable files
.env
.env.test          # ← Added this
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
.env.local
```

### 2. Removed from Git Tracking
```bash
git rm --cached backend/.env.test
```

This removes the file from git tracking while keeping it locally for development.

## 🛡️ **Security Status:**
- ✅ `.env.test` is now gitignored
- ✅ File removed from git tracking
- ✅ Local file preserved for testing
- ✅ Sensitive data no longer in version control

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. **Commit these changes** to apply the security fix
2. **Review git history** - the file was previously committed, so sensitive data exists in git history
3. **Consider rotating credentials** if this is a public repository
4. **Team notification** - inform team members about this security practice

## 🔍 **Files Now Properly Gitignored:**
- `.env` (production secrets)
- `.env.test` (test environment secrets)
- `.env.local` (local development secrets)
- `.env.development.local`
- `.env.test.local`
- `.env.production.local`

## 💡 **Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ All environment files with secrets are gitignored
- ✅ Only `.env.example` files are tracked (without real secrets)
- ✅ Test environment properly secured
- ✅ Production environment remains secure

The security issue has been resolved! 🛡️
