# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the user experience gap where avatar/profile picture upload functionality exists but is not easily accessible from the main settings page. Currently, users can only upload their profile picture by navigating to their profile page and clicking "Edit Profile", which is not intuitive. The avatar upload should be integrated into the main settings page where users naturally expect to find profile customization options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Avatar Upload in Settings Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage my profile picture from the main settings page, so that I can easily customize my profile without having to navigate through multiple pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the settings page (/settings) THEN the system SHALL display a profile picture upload section in the Profile Information area
2. WHEN I have no profile picture THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar with an upload option
3. WHEN I have an existing profile picture THEN the system SHALL display my current avatar with options to change or remove it
4. WHEN I upload a new profile picture THEN the system SHALL use the existing ProfilePictureUpload component functionality
5. WHEN I successfully upload a profile picture THEN the system SHALL update my avatar across the entire application
6. IF I remove my profile picture THEN the system SHALL revert to the default avatar display

### Requirement 2: Maintain Existing Edit Profile Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing profile editing functionality to continue working, so that I have multiple ways to access profile customization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Edit Profile page (/profile/edit) THEN the system SHALL continue to display the profile picture upload functionality
2. WHEN I update my profile picture from either location THEN the system SHALL synchronize the changes across both pages
3. WHEN I navigate between settings and edit profile pages THEN the system SHALL display consistent profile picture state
4. IF I make changes in one location THEN the system SHALL reflect those changes in the other location without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 3: Consistent User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent and intuitive experience when managing my profile picture, so that I can easily find and use this functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the settings page THEN the system SHALL display the profile picture section prominently within the Profile Information area
2. WHEN I interact with the avatar upload THEN the system SHALL provide the same drag-and-drop, file selection, and preview functionality as the existing implementation
3. WHEN upload operations complete THEN the system SHALL show appropriate success/error messages consistent with the existing implementation
4. WHEN I view my profile picture in other parts of the application THEN the system SHALL display the updated image immediately after upload
5. IF there are upload errors THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages to help me resolve the issue

### Requirement 4: Performance and Usability

**User Story:** As a user, I want profile picture uploads to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly customize my profile without technical difficulties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a profile picture THEN the system SHALL show upload progress and loading states
2. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN I navigate away during upload THEN the system SHALL handle the operation gracefully
4. WHEN I have a slow internet connection THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback about upload progress
5. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL allow me to retry without losing my file selection
6. WHEN I upload large images THEN the system SHALL handle resizing and optimization as per existing functionality
