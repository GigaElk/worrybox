# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical user experience improvements and bug fixes for the Worrybox platform. The focus is on enhancing social features, fixing runtime errors, and improving the overall user interaction experience. These improvements will make the platform more engaging and reliable for users sharing and supporting each other through their worries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Show Support Feature Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user reading someone's worry post, I want to show support instead of just "liking" it, so that I can express empathy and encouragement in a more meaningful way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a worry post THEN the system SHALL display a "Show Support" button instead of a "Like" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Show Support" THEN the system SHALL record the support action with the same backend functionality as likes
3. WHEN displaying support counts THEN the system SHALL show "X people showed support" instead of "X likes"
4. WHEN a user has already shown support THEN the system SHALL display "Support Shown" or similar supportive language
5. IF the backend like functionality exists THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API endpoints and database structure

### Requirement 2: Me Too Functionality

**User Story:** As a user reading a worry post, I want to indicate "Me Too" to show I have similar concerns, so that the original poster knows they're not alone and the system can track similar worries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a worry post THEN the system SHALL display a "Me Too" button alongside the "Show Support" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Me Too" THEN the system SHALL record this as a similar worry indicator
3. WHEN the AI processes worry similarity THEN the system SHALL include "Me Too" responses in the similar worries count
4. WHEN displaying worry statistics THEN the system SHALL show "X people have similar worries" 
5. WHEN a user has already indicated "Me Too" THEN the system SHALL show "You also worry about this" or similar confirmation
6. IF a user clicks "Me Too" multiple times THEN the system SHALL only count it once per user per post

### Requirement 3: User Following System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to follow other users whose posts I find helpful or relatable, so that I can stay updated on their journey and provide ongoing support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing another user's profile THEN the system SHALL display a "Follow" button
2. WHEN a user clicks "Follow" THEN the system SHALL add the target user to their following list
3. WHEN a user is already following someone THEN the system SHALL display an "Unfollow" button
4. WHEN viewing my profile THEN the system SHALL show my followers and following counts
5. WHEN a followed user creates a new post THEN the system SHALL include it in my personalized feed
6. IF I try to follow myself THEN the system SHALL prevent this action
7. WHEN I unfollow a user THEN the system SHALL remove them from my following list immediately

### Requirement 4: User Profile Pictures

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and display a profile picture, so that I can personalize my account and make my interactions more recognizable to other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing my profile settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to upload a profile picture
2. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL validate it is a supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF)
3. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL resize it to appropriate dimensions for display
4. WHEN I have no profile picture THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar or initials
5. WHEN other users view my posts THEN the system SHALL display my profile picture next to my content
6. IF I upload a new picture THEN the system SHALL replace my previous picture
7. WHEN I delete my profile picture THEN the system SHALL revert to the default avatar

### Requirement 5: Runtime Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a user browsing the platform, I want the application to work smoothly without errors, so that I can focus on sharing and receiving support without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading posts with no likes/support THEN the system SHALL display "0 support" instead of generating errors
2. WHEN the frontend requests like data THEN the system SHALL handle empty results gracefully
3. WHEN API endpoints return 404 errors THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately without excessive warnings
4. WHEN displaying user interactions THEN the system SHALL handle missing data without breaking the UI
5. IF database queries return empty results THEN the system SHALL return appropriate empty arrays or default values
6. WHEN users interact with features THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback for both success and error states

### Requirement 6: Logging and Error Handling Improvements

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clean, actionable logs without excessive noise, so that I can effectively monitor the system and identify real issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legitimate 404 requests occur THEN the system SHALL log them at INFO level, not WARN level
2. WHEN requests complete successfully THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate log entries
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN the system SHALL log clear status messages for all services
5. IF memory usage is high but stable THEN the system SHALL reduce warning frequency
6. WHEN correlation IDs are used THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all related log entries
