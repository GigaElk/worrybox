# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Worrybox backend service deployed on Render.com experiences daily failures that disrupt user access. The current logging and monitoring infrastructure is insufficient to diagnose root causes, and the application lacks proper error recovery mechanisms. This feature will implement comprehensive monitoring, error recovery, and reliability improvements to ensure stable 24/7 operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging so that I can quickly identify and resolve service failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL log detailed startup information including memory usage, database connectivity, and all initialized services
2. WHEN a service failure occurs THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error context including stack traces, memory usage, database connection status, and request details
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL log a warning with memory breakdown details
4. WHEN database queries take longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL log slow query warnings with execution details
5. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return detailed status of all critical components within 5 seconds

### Requirement 2: Automatic Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a service user, I want the system to automatically recover from transient failures so that service interruptions are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN memory usage exceeds 90% THEN the system SHALL trigger garbage collection and log memory cleanup results
3. WHEN unhandled errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error details and continue operation without crashing
4. WHEN scheduler services fail THEN the system SHALL restart the failed scheduler and log the recovery attempt
5. WHEN the database becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue critical operations and retry when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 3: Resource Management and Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient resource usage so that the service remains stable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize database connections with proper pooling and timeout settings
2. WHEN schedulers are running THEN the system SHALL monitor their memory usage and restart them if they exceed thresholds
3. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN the system SHALL implement request timeouts and proper cleanup
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all database connections and stop all schedulers
5. WHEN multiple services are initialized THEN the system SHALL stagger their startup to prevent resource contention

### Requirement 4: Production Debugging Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed production debugging information so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log request correlation IDs for tracing user sessions
2. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide endpoint-specific performance metrics
3. WHEN database issues occur THEN the system SHALL log connection pool status and query performance
4. WHEN memory issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide heap dump capabilities for analysis
5. WHEN the service is under load THEN the system SHALL track and log key performance indicators

### Requirement 5: Render.com Specific Optimizations

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want optimizations specific to Render.com hosting so that the service runs reliably on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts on Render THEN the system SHALL detect the platform and apply Render-specific configurations
2. WHEN Render restarts the service THEN the system SHALL handle cold starts efficiently with proper initialization sequencing
3. WHEN Render's health checks run THEN the system SHALL respond within 10 seconds with accurate health status
4. WHEN the service is idle THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal resource usage while staying responsive
5. WHEN Render's memory limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement proactive memory management
