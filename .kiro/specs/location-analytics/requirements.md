# Location-Based Analytics Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing location-based analytics as a premium feature for Worrybox. The system will provide aggregated geographic insights about worry patterns while maintaining strict privacy protections and user control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User-Controlled Location Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optionally share my location to contribute to community insights while maintaining full control over my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I access my settings THEN I should see optional location fields
2. WHEN I provide my location THEN it should be clearly marked as optional and voluntary
3. WHEN I choose not to provide location THEN the system should work normally without it
4. WHEN I provide location THEN I should see clear explanations of how it will be used
5. IF I change my mind THEN I should be able to remove or update my location at any time

### Requirement 2: IP-Based Geographic Inference

**User Story:** As a system, I want to infer general geographic regions from IP addresses for anonymous analytics without storing personal location data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user makes a request THEN the system may infer country/region from IP address
2. WHEN using IP geolocation THEN no personal identifiers should be stored with location data
3. WHEN aggregating data THEN IP-derived locations should only be used for anonymous statistics
4. IF a user provides voluntary location THEN it should take precedence over IP inference
5. WHEN storing analytics THEN individual IP addresses should never be permanently stored

### Requirement 3: Premium Geographic Analytics

**User Story:** As a premium subscriber (researcher/organization), I want to see aggregated geographic patterns of worry topics to understand regional mental health trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I have premium access THEN I should see geographic analytics dashboard
2. WHEN viewing geographic data THEN all data should be aggregated and anonymized
3. WHEN data is insufficient THEN the system should show "insufficient data" rather than potentially identifiable information
4. WHEN filtering by region THEN I should see worry categories, sentiment trends, and topic patterns
5. IF privacy thresholds aren't met THEN data should be suppressed or generalized

### Requirement 4: Privacy Protection and Compliance

**User Story:** As a user, I want my location data to be handled with the highest privacy standards and in compliance with data protection laws.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN providing location THEN I should see clear privacy notices and consent options
2. WHEN my data is used THEN it should only be in aggregated, anonymized form for analytics
3. WHEN I request data deletion THEN all my location data should be removed
4. WHEN accessing from EU THEN GDPR compliance should be maintained
5. IF I opt out THEN no location tracking should occur at any level

### Requirement 5: Minimum Data Thresholds

**User Story:** As a system, I want to ensure that geographic analytics cannot be used to identify individuals or small groups.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN aggregating data THEN minimum thresholds should be enforced (e.g., 50+ users per region)
2. WHEN data is below threshold THEN it should be grouped into larger regions or suppressed
3. WHEN displaying analytics THEN individual users should never be identifiable
4. IF combining filters reduces data below threshold THEN results should be generalized
5. WHEN exporting data THEN additional privacy protections should be applied

### Requirement 6: Privacy Policy and Terms Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be clearly informed about how my data is used for anonymous statistics so I can make informed decisions about my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I register THEN I should see clear disclosure about anonymous data usage for service improvement
2. WHEN I provide location data THEN I should see specific explanations about geographic analytics
3. WHEN viewing privacy policy THEN it should clearly state that anonymous aggregated data is used for statistics
4. WHEN opting into location sharing THEN I should understand that my data contributes to anonymous regional insights
5. IF I have questions about data usage THEN clear contact information should be provided for privacy inquiries

### Requirement 7: Data Retention and Deletion

**User Story:** As a user, I want control over how long my location data is retained and the ability to delete it completely.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN I delete my account THEN all my location data should be permanently removed
2. WHEN I opt out of location sharing THEN my existing location data should be deleted within 30 days
3. WHEN data is used for analytics THEN only aggregated statistics should be retained, not individual records
4. IF I request data export THEN I should receive all my stored location data
5. WHEN location data is no longer needed THEN it should be automatically purged according to retention policies
