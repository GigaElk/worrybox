# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Worrybox is a dual blogging platform designed to help users externalize their worries and concerns by writing them down, reducing mental burden through expression. The platform combines Twitter-like short-form worry posts with optional longer blog entries, featuring privacy controls, AI-moderated comments, and scheduling capabilities to create a safe, supportive environment for users to process their concerns.
