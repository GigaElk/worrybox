## Health Checks

### üè• Automated Verification

Run the deployment verification script:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export API_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
export DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
export TEST_USER_ID=test-user-id
export TEST_POST_ID=test-post-id

# Run verification
node scripts/verify_deployment.js
```

- [ ] **Verification Script Results**
  - [ ] All database tests pass
  - [ ] All API endpoint tests pass
  - [ ] All environment tests pass
  - [ ] All health check tests pass

### üîß Manual Health Checks

- [ ] **API Health**
  ```bash
  curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health
  ```

- [ ] **Database Health**
  ```bash
  curl -f https://your-domain.com/api/health/database
