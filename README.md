# Worrybox

A compassionate social platform designed to help users externalize their worries through structured posting, optional elaboration, and supportive community interaction.

## Overview

Worrybox combines Twitter-like short-form worry posts with optional longer blog entries, featuring privacy controls, AI-moderated comments, and scheduling capabilities to create a safe, supportive environment for users to process their concerns.

## Features

- **Worry Posting**: Share concerns with structured prompts like "I am worried about..." or "I worry that..."
- **Privacy Controls**: Choose between public, friends-only, or private visibility
- **AI Moderation**: Protect vulnerable users with intelligent comment filtering
- **Community Support**: Connect with others facing similar concerns
- **Scheduling**: Post worries at appropriate times
- **Analytics**: Track patterns and progress (paid tiers)
- **Guided Exercises**: Access coping techniques and mental health resources
- **Multi-language Support**: Use the platform in your preferred language
