# Comprehensive Error Handling System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive error handling system implemented for the similar worries functionality. The system provides graceful degradation, user-friendly error messages, retry mechanisms, and ensures that failures in one component don't break the entire application.

## Architecture

### 1. Error Boundaries
- **ErrorBoundary**: Generic error boundary for catching React component errors
- **SimilarWorriesErrorBoundary**: Specialized for similar worries components
- **CountErrorBoundary**: Specialized for count display components

### 2. Error Handling Hook
- **useErrorHandler**: Custom hook for consistent error handling across components
- **useApiErrorHandler**: Specialized for API-related errors
- **useSilentErrorHandler**: For background operations without user notifications

### 3. Error Display Components
- **ErrorDisplay**: Flexible error display component with multiple variants
- **SimilarWorriesError**: Specialized error for similar worries features
- **CountError**: Specialized error for count components
- **PrivacyError**: Specialized error for privacy violations
- **NetworkError**: Specialized error for network issues

### 4. Retry Mechanisms
- **withRetry**: Utility function for retrying failed operations
- **CircuitBreaker**: Prevents cascading failures by temporarily disabling failing services
- **Exponential backoff**: Intelligent retry timing to avoid overwhelming services

### 5. Toast Notifications
- **ToastNotification**: System for showing temporary error messages
- **ToastProvider**: Context provider for global toast management

## Error Types

### WorryAnalysisError Types
1. **NOT_FOUND**: Resource doesn't exist (404)
2. **PRIVACY_VIOLATION**: Access denied due to privacy settings (403)
3. **NETWORK_ERROR**: Connection or server issues (5xx, network failures)
4. **UNAUTHORIZED**: Authentication required (401)
5. **RATE_LIMITED**: Too many requests (429)
6. **UNKNOWN**: Unexpected errors

### Error Handling Strategies

#### 1. Graceful Degradation
- Components fail independently without breaking the entire page
- Fallback UI shows when primary functionality fails
- Essential features remain available even when secondary features fail

#### 2. User-Friendly Messages
- Technical errors are translated to user-friendly language
- Clear indication of what went wrong and what users can do
- Contextual help based on error type

#### 3. Retry Logic
- Automatic retries for transient failures (network issues, timeouts)
- No retries for permanent failures (404, 403, 401)
- Exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming failing services
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

#### 4. Independent Component Loading
- Each section of the page loads independently
- Failures in one component don't affect others
- Loading states are maintained per component

## Implementation Details

### Component-Level Error Handling

#### SimilarWorriesList
```typescript
// Enhanced with comprehensive error handling
- Circuit breaker protection
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Privacy-aware error messages
- Graceful fallback to empty state
- Error boundary wrapper
```

#### MeTooCount
```typescript
// Resilient count display
- Fallback to zero count on errors
- Inline error display
- Retry capability for transient failures
- Circuit breaker protection
```

#### SimilarWorriesCount
```typescript
// Combined count with breakdown
- Separate error handling for count vs breakdown
- Real-time updates via event listeners
- Fallback values to prevent UI breaking
- Error boundary protection
```

#### WorryAnalysisPage
```typescript
// Page-level error orchestration
- Independent error boundaries for each section
- Retry capability for main post loading
- Graceful degradation when sections fail
- User-friendly error messages with navigation
```

### Error Recovery Patterns

#### 1. Automatic Recovery
- Retry transient failures automatically
- Circuit breaker recovery after timeout
- Real-time updates when services recover

#### 2. Manual Recovery
- Retry buttons for user-initiated recovery
- Clear error messages explaining the issue
- Guidance on next steps

#### 3. Fallback Strategies
- Show cached data when available
- Provide alternative functionality
- Maintain core user experience

## Testing Strategy

### Error Scenarios Covered
1. **Network Failures**: Connection timeouts, server errors
2. **Privacy Violations**: Unauthorized access attempts
3. **Service Unavailability**: API endpoints down
4. **Rate Limiting**: Too many requests
5. **Component Crashes**: React component errors
6. **Cascading Failures**: Multiple services failing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for error handling utilities
- Component tests for error states
- Integration tests for error recovery
- End-to-end tests for user experience

## Usage Examples

### Basic Error Handling
```typescript
const { errorState, handleError, retry } = useErrorHandler()

try {
  const data = await apiCall()
} catch (error) {
  handleError(error, 'Loading data')
}

if (errorState.isError) {
  return <ErrorDisplay {...errorState} onRetry={retry} />
}
```

### With Retry Logic
```typescript
const loadData = async () => {
  return await withRetry(
    () => apiService.getData(),
    {
      maxAttempts: 3,
      baseDelay: 1000,
      onRetry: (attempt, error) => {
        console.log(`Retry attempt ${attempt}:`, error.message)
      }
    }
  )
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Usage
```typescript
const result = await circuitBreaker.execute(async () => {
  return await apiService.riskyOperation()
})
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Error Message Guidelines

- Explain what happened and why
- Provide actionable next steps
- Be empathetic and helpful

### 2. Retry Strategy
- Only retry transient failures
- Use exponential backoff
- Limit retry attempts
- Provide user feedback during retries

### 3. Component Design
- Fail gracefully without breaking parent components
- Provide meaningful fallback UI
